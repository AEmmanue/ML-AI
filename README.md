Portfolio of Machine Learning & AI projects (Classification, NLP, Time-Series)


1Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Churn Prediction ‚Äì Classification (Telco Dataset)

Objective: Predict whether a customer will leave (churn) based on demographics and usage behavior.
Tools & Libraries: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, matplotlib, seaborn

üîπ Workflow:

Data cleaning & feature engineering (contract type, tenure, monthly charges)

Baseline model (Logistic Regression) ‚Üí advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

Performance evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC)

Feature importance analysis

üîπ Results:

Logistic Regression: Accuracy = 79%, ROC-AUC = 0.84

Random Forest: Accuracy = 79%, ROC-AUC = 0.82

XGBoost: Accuracy = 78%, ROC-AUC = 0.82

Key drivers of churn: short contract length, high monthly charges, low tenure

üîπ Business Value:
Helps identify at-risk customers for targeted retention campaigns (e.g., discounts, loyalty programs).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Airbnb Review Sentiment Analysis ‚Äì NLP (Text Classification)

Objective: Classify Airbnb guest reviews into positive, neutral, or negative sentiment to uncover customer experience insights.
Tools & Libraries: Python, pandas, nltk, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, seaborn, matplotlib

üîπ Workflow:

Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)

Weak label generation with TextBlob (positive/negative/neutral)

ML Models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes with TF-IDF features

DL Model: LSTM with word embeddings

Model evaluation with classification reports & confusion matrices

üîπ Results:

Logistic Regression: ~78% accuracy

Naive Bayes: ~77% accuracy

LSTM: ~82% accuracy (best performance on longer reviews)

Sentiment distribution: majority reviews positive; negative reviews often mention cleanliness and noise

üîπ Business Value:
Provides hosts and platforms with insights into guest satisfaction drivers and areas for improvement.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Sales Forecasting ‚Äì Time-Series Regression (Retail Data)

Objective: Forecast future sales performance for a retail dataset to support inventory and pricing decisions.
Tools & Libraries: Python, pandas, statsmodels, Prophet, matplotlib, seaborn

üîπ Workflow:

Time-series decomposition (trend, seasonality, residuals)

ARIMA and Prophet forecasting models

Evaluation using RMSE and MAPE

Visualization of actual vs forecasted sales

üîπ Results:

Prophet model captured seasonality and holiday effects better than ARIMA

Achieved low forecast error (<10% MAPE) on validation data

Forecast plots highlight sales spikes during holiday seasons

üîπ Business Value:
Supports demand planning, inventory management, and pricing strategy, reducing stockouts and overstock risks.

‚öôÔ∏è Skills Demonstrated
